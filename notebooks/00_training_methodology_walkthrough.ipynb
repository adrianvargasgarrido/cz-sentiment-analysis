    "```python\n",
    "# Traditional SGD:\n",
    "weight = weight - learning_rate × gradient\n",
    "\n",
    "# Adam adds two components:\n",
    "# 1. Momentum (first moment): Running average of gradients\n",
    "# 2. RMSprop (second moment): Running average of squared gradients\n",
    "\n",
    "# Simplified AdamW update:\n",
    "m = beta1 × m + (1 - beta1) × gradient        # Momentum\n",
    "v = beta2 × v + (1 - beta2) × gradient²       # Adaptive LR\n",

    "   Parameter with large gradients → smaller effective LR (divide by sqrt(v))\n",

    "\n",
    "1. **Start with defaults** - They work surprisingly well\n",
    "2. **Change one thing at a time** - So you know what helped\n",
    "3. **Trust validation loss** - Not training loss\n",
    "4. **Early stopping** - If val_loss increases 2 epochs → stop\n",
    "5. **Log everything** - You'll forget what worked\n",

    "**What happens in each iteration:**\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "For each epoch (3 total):\n",
    "  For each batch (438 batches):\n",
    "    \n",
    "    1️⃣ DATA LOADING (parallel workers):\n",
    "       Worker 1: Loads batch N → tokenizes → creates tensors\n",
    "       Worker 2: Loads batch N+1 (ready when needed)\n",
    "       Main process: Gets batch from queue\n",
    "    \n",
    "    2️⃣ FORWARD PASS (main process):\n",
    "       [16, 128] tokens → ELECTRA encoder → [16, 3] logits\n",
    "       Calculate loss = average cross-entropy over 16 samples\n",
    "    \n",
    "    3️⃣ BACKWARD PASS:\n",
    "       Compute ∂loss/∂weight for all 13M parameters\n",
    "       Gradients averaged across 16 samples\n",
    "    \n",
    "    4️⃣ GRADIENT CLIPPING:\n",
    "       Prevents exploding gradients (max_norm=1.0)\n",
    "       If gradient > 1.0, scale it down\n",
    "    \n",
    "    5️⃣ OPTIMIZER STEP:\n",
    "       Update weights: w = w - lr × gradient\n",
    "       AdamW uses momentum + adaptive learning rates\n",
    "    \n",
    "    6️⃣ SCHEDULER STEP:\n",
    "       Adjust learning rate (warmup → peak → decay)\n",
    "  \n",
    "  End of epoch: Run validation to check progress\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key theoretical concepts:**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Gradient Accumulation (what we're NOT doing, but could):**\n",
    "- Instead of updating every batch, accumulate gradients over N batches\n",
    "- Simulates larger batch size without memory cost\n",
    "- Example: accumulate 2 batches → effective batch_size = 32\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why Batch Size Matters:**\n",
    "- **Small batches (4-8)**: Noisy gradients, better generalization, slower\n",
    "- **Medium batches (16-32)**: Good balance (your choice) ✅\n",
    "- **Large batches (64+)**: Smooth gradients, faster, but may overfit\n",
    "\n",
    "**The Learning Rate Schedule:**\n",
    "- **Warmup (10%)**: lr gradually increases 0 → 2e-5\n",
    "  - Prevents shock to pre-trained weights\n",
    "- **Linear Decay (90%)**: lr gradually decreases 2e-5 → 0\n",
    "  - Allows fine-tuning as model converges\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why 3 Epochs?**\n",
    "- Transformers are pre-trained, so they learn fast\n",
    "- More epochs risk overfitting (memorizing training data)\n",
    "- Watch validation loss: if it increases, stop early!"
